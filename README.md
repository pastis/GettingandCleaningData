This document describes the data and transformations used by *run_analysis.R* and the definition of variables in *mean_std_analysis.txt*.

##Dataset Used

This data is obtained from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set". The data linked are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>.

The data set used can be downloaded from <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>. 

##Input Data Set

The input data containts the following data files:

- `X_train.txt` contains variable features that are intended for training.
- `y_train.txt` contains the activities corresponding to `X_train.txt`.
- `subject_train.txt` contains information on the subjects from whom data is collected.
- `X_test.txt` contains variable features that are intended for testing.
- `y_test.txt` contains the activities corresponding to `X_test.txt`.
- `subject_test.txt` contains information on the subjects from whom data is collected.
- `activity_labels.txt` contains metadata on the different types of activities.
- `features.txt` contains the name of the features in the data sets.

##Transformations

Following are the transformations that were performed on the input dataset:

- `X_train.txt` is read into `training.features`.
- `y_train.txt` is read into `training.activities`.
- `subject_train.txt` is read into `training.subjects`.
- `X_test.txt` is read into `testing.features`.
- `y_test.txt` is read into `testing.activities`.
- `subject_test.txt` is read into `testing.subjects`.
- `features.txt` is read into `feature.names`.
- `activity_labels.txt` is read into `activity.labels`.
- The subjects in training and test set data are merged to form `subject.id`.
- The activities in training and test set data are merged to form `activity`.
- The features of test and training are merged to form `all.required.features`.
- The name of the features are set in `required.feature.names` from `features.names`.
- `features`, `activity` and `subject` are merged to form `required.data.frame`.
- Indices of columns that contain std or mean, activity and subject are taken into `required.feature.names` .
- `required.data.frame` is created with data from columns in `required.feature.names`.
- `activity` column in `required.data.frame` is updated with descriptive names of activities taken from `activity.labels`. `activity` column is expressed as a factor variable.
- Acronyms in variable names in `required.data.frame`, like 'Acc', 'Gyro', 'Mag', 't' and 'f' are replaced with descriptive labels such as 'Accelerometer', 'Gyroscpoe', 'Magnitude', 'Time' and 'Frequency'.
- `final.analysis.frame` is created as a set with average for each activity and subject of `require.data.frame`. Entries in `final.required.analysis.frame` are ordered based on activity and subject.
- Finally, the data in `final.analysis.frame` is written into `mean_std_analysis.txt`.

##Output Data Set

The output data `mean_std_analysis.txt` is a a space-delimited value file. The header line contains the names of the variables. It contains the mean and standard deviation values of the data contained in the input files.
